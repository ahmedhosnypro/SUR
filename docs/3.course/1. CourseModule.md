## Course Module 

**I. Overview:**

The Course Module is a core component of the system responsible for managing all aspects of individual courses, including content delivery, student progress tracking, assessments (quizzes), and interaction with other modules like Grades and Certification.

**II. Core Functionalities:**

* **Content Management:**  Storing and delivering various types of learning content:
    * Video lectures
    * Audio lectures
    * Text-based materials (readings, articles)
    * Downloadable resources (PDFs, presentations)
* **Content Structure:** Organizing content into a hierarchical structure:
    * Modules/Sections
    * Lectures within modules/sections
    * Sequential or non-linear progression (defined by course settings)
* **Progress Tracking:**  Automatically tracking student progress through the course, including:
    * Lecture completion status
    * Quiz scores and attempts
    * Assignment submissions (if applicable)
* **Access Control:**  Managing content access based on:
    * Enrollment status: Only enrolled students can access course content.
    * Prerequisites:  Restricting access to content until specified requirements are met (e.g., completing a previous lecture or module).
    * Start/End Dates:  Controlling content availability based on predefined dates. 
* **Assessment Management:**
    * Quiz Creation and Delivery:  Creating and delivering quizzes associated with lectures or modules.
    * Quiz Grading:  Automated grading for objective questions; manual grading support for subjective answers.
    * Quiz Feedback: Providing feedback to students on their quiz performance.
* **Communication and Interaction:**
    * Comments Section: Facilitating discussions and Q&A related to lecture content.
    * Announcement System: Enabling instructors to post course-wide announcements.
* **Integration with Other Modules:**
    * Grades Module: Sending quiz scores and other assessment data to the Grades Module for overall grade calculation.
    * Certification Module:  Triggering certificate generation upon successful course completion.

**IV.  Automation of Student Progress:**

* **Lecture Completion:**  The system automatically marks a lecture as "Completed" when the student:
    * Reaches the end of the video lecture.
    * Marks the lecture as complete manually (if a self-paced learning option is enabled). 
* **Quiz Attempts and Scores:**  The system records quiz attempts, scores, and feedback.
* **Prerequisite Checking:** The module checks prerequisite completion before granting access to lectures or modules.
* **Course Completion:** The system marks a course as complete when all required lectures, quizzes, and other assessments within the course have been completed.

**V. Automation of Certificate Generation:**

Upon successful course completion, the course module notifies the Certification Module, which triggers the generation of a course completion certificate.
