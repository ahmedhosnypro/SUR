**Product Requirements Document: Abstract Courses Listing Page**

**1. Introduction**

**1.1 Purpose**

This page will serve as a catalog of courses available to anyone, regardless of their enrollment status in a specific program.  It's a crucial element for engaging potential students and showcasing the breadth of learning opportunities.

**1.2 Goals**

*   **Attract Users:** To provide an easily navigable and visually appealing catalog of abstract courses.
*   **Encourage Exploration:** To enable users to easily browse, search, and filter courses based on their interests.
*   **Promote Enrollment:** To clearly present course information and simplify the enrollment process.
*   **Maintain Consistency:** To ensure a consistent user experience with other course listing pages (like the Program Listing page).
*   **Handle Restrictions:** To gracefully display and handle restricted courses (those with prerequisites).

**2. Target Audience**

*   **Public Users:** Non-logged-in visitors exploring the website.
*   **Registered Users:** Users with accounts who haven't enrolled in a program.
*   **Enrolled Students:** Students enrolled in one or more programs, looking for additional learning opportunities.  *Even though enrolled students will primarily interact with courses within their program context, the Abstract Courses Listing page needs to be accessible to them.*


**4.  Features**

**4.1. Page Structure and Layout**

*   **Layout Options:**
    *   **Grid View:** Courses presented in a grid format (e.g., 2-3 courses per row).  This is visually appealing and good for showcasing course images.
    *   **List View(Optional, Phase2):** Courses presented in a vertical list.  This can be more compact and suitable for longer course descriptions.
    *   *Recommendation: Provide a toggle switch to allow users to switch between Grid view and List View.*

*   **Page Elements:**
    *   **Heading:** A clear page title (e.g., "Open Courses," "Independent Learning," "Explore Courses").
    *   **Introductory Text (Optional):** A brief paragraph explaining the purpose of abstract courses and their accessibility.
    *   **Course Cards:** (See details in section 4.2)
    *   **Search Bar:** (See details in section 4.3)
    *   **Filters (Optional):** (See details in section 4.4)
    *   **Pagination (If needed):** If there are many courses, implement pagination controls.
    *   **Sorting options.** Default Sort option, and by Popularity.

**4.2. Course Card Design**

Each course will be represented by a card containing the following information:

*   **Course Thumbnail:** A visually appealing image representing the course.
*   **Course Title:** The full name of the course.
*   **Short Description:** A concise (e.g., 1–2 sentence) summary of the course content.
*   **Instructor(s):** The name(s) of the instructor(s) teaching the course.
*   **Duration (Optional):** Estimated time to complete the course.
*   **Price (If Applicable):** The cost of the course (or "Free" if it is free).
*   **Enrollment Status:**
    *   **"Enroll Now" Button:** A prominent call-to-action button for courses that are open for enrollment.
    *   **"Learn More" Button** A Prominent call-to-action button for user to view course page.
    *   **"Restricted" Label (If Applicable):** Clearly indicate if the course has prerequisites or is otherwise restricted:
        *   **Visual Cue:** A lock icon or other visual indicator.
        *   **Label Text:** "Restricted" or "Prerequisites Required."
        *   **Tooltip (on hover):** A brief explanation of the restriction (e.g., "Requires completion of [Prerequisite Course]").

**4.3. Search Functionality**

*   **Search Bar:** A prominent search bar that allows users to find courses by keyword (title, description, instructor).
*   **Real-time Suggestions (Optional):** As the user types, provide suggestions for matching course titles.
*   **Search Results:** Display matching courses using the same Course Card design.

**4.4. Filtering (Optional, Phase 2)**

If there are many abstract courses, consider including filters to help users narrow down their choices:

*   **Category:** Filter by subject area or topic.

**4.5. Handling Restricted Courses**

*   **Visibility:** Restricted courses *will* be displayed on the listing page.
*   **Enrollment Button:** The "Enroll Now" button will be disabled (grayed out).
*   **Visual Indicator:** A "Restricted" label and/or a lock icon will appear on the course card.
*   **Tooltip:** Hovering over the "Restricted" label or the disabled button will display a tooltip explaining the reason for the restriction (e.g., "Requires completion of Introduction to Programming").
*   **Link to Prerequisite (If Possible):** Ideally, the tooltip or a separate link will direct the user to the prerequisite course or program.

**4.6. Access from Different User Contexts**

*   **Non-Enrolled Users:** The page will be directly accessible from the main navigation (e.g., a link labeled "Open Courses").
*   **Enrolled Students:** Even within a program context, a clear link to the Abstract Courses Listing page should be available in the navigation (either in the main navbar or a secondary menu).  This encourages ongoing learning.

**5.  User Interface (UI) Design**

*   **Visual Consistency:** Maintain visual consistency with the Program Listing page and other course-related pages. Use the same Course Card design, font styles, and color scheme.
*   **Clear Visual Hierarchy:** Use headings, font sizes, spacing, and color to guide the user's eye and highlight important information.
*   **Mobile Responsiveness:** The page must be fully responsive, adapting to different screen sizes. 

**6.  Technical Requirements**

*   **Dynamic Data:** Course information should be loaded dynamically from the backend database.
*   **Filtering and Sorting:** Implement server-side filtering and sorting functionality to optimize performance.
*   **Pagination:** If numerous courses are displayed, implement pagination to break the list into manageable pages.
*   **Error Handling:** Handle cases where no courses are found or if there are errors fetching data.

**7. Future Considerations**

*   **User Ratings and Reviews:** Allow users to rate and review abstract courses.
*   **Personalized Recommendations:** Recommend abstract courses to users based on their interests or past enrollment history
