# Program Progress Automation

## Automating Student Progression and Cohort Management

This outlines the functionality for automating student progression from one academic year to the next, cohort enrollment, handling failed progression, and merging progress between cohorts.

**1. Automatic Progression:**

* **End-of-Year Evaluation:** At the end of each academic year, the system automatically evaluates each student's performance based on predefined progression rules (e.g., minimum GPA, maximum number of failed courses).
* **Progression Status:** Students are assigned one of the following progression statuses:
    * **Promoted:** Meets all requirements and automatically progresses to the next academic year within their current cohort.
    * **Conditional Promotion (Optional):** Meets some but not all requirements. Might require completing additional coursework or meeting specific conditions before full promotion.
    * **Not Promoted:** Fails to meet the minimum requirements and is moved to the next cohort's equivalent academic year.
* **Cohort Assignment for Promoted Students:** Promoted students retain their association with their current cohort and are automatically enrolled in the next academic year's courses within that cohort.
* **Notification:** Students receive notifications about their progression status, including any requirements for conditional promotion or reasons for not being promoted.

**2. Cohort Enrollment:**

* **Initial Enrollment:** Upon program application and acceptance, students are automatically assigned to the next available cohort. This could be based on application date, program start dates, or seat availability.
* **Single Cohort Enrollment:** The system enforces the rule that a student can only be enrolled in a single cohort for a given program at any time. Attempts to enroll in a second cohort for the same program are prevented.
* **Welcome and Onboarding:** After cohort assignment, students receive a welcome message with instructions on how to access course materials, join their cohort's community (e.g., Telegram group), and navigate the student dashboard.

**3. Handling Failed Progression (Moving to Next Cohort):**

* **Cohort Transfer:** If a student fails to meet the progression requirements, they are automatically transferred to the next cohort associated with their program. This assumes that a new cohort starts in the following academic year.
* **Progress Merging:**
    * **Passed Courses:** Grades and credits from passed courses in the previous cohort are transferred to the student's record in the new cohort. These courses are marked as "completed" and the student does not have to retake them.
    * **Failed Courses:**  Students must retake failed courses within the new cohort's curriculum structure. Grade information from the previous attempt is not carried over, but a record of the previous attempt might be kept for administrative purposes.
    * **Curriculum Differences:** If there are curriculum differences between the cohorts (e.g., updated courses, new modules) the system handles this by:
        * **Mapping Equivalent Courses:**  If a failed course in the previous cohort has an equivalent in the new cohort, the system automatically enrolls the student in the equivalent course.
        * **Administrative Intervention:** If there is no direct equivalent, administrators might need to manually review the student's transcript and place them in appropriate courses within the new cohort.
* **Notification:** Students are notified about their transfer to the next cohort, the status of their transferred grades, and the courses they need to retake.

**4.  Technical Implementation:**

* **Database Structure:** The database must store data related to:
    * Student progression status.
    * Cohort enrollment details.
    * Course grades and credits.
    * Cohort curriculum structure.
* **Backend Logic:** Implement the logic for automatic progression evaluation, cohort assignment, progress transfer, and handling curriculum differences.
* **Frontend Components:** Create UI elements to display progression status, cohort information, and course enrollment details to students.


**Example Scenario:**

A student, John, is enrolled in the 2023 cohort of the Computer Science program. He fails two courses at the end of the academic year. Since he hasn't failed more than the allowed limit (e.g., 3 courses), he is automatically promoted to the second year within the 2023 cohort. However, he needs to retake the two failed courses.

Another student, Mary, enrolls in the same program but fails four courses. She is automatically transferred to the 2024 cohort and starts from the first year. Her passing grades are carried over, but she must retake the four failed courses within the 2024 cohort's curriculum. 

This detailed functionality ensures a smooth and automated cohort management system, effectively handling student progression, failed progression, and the transfer of grades and certificates between cohorts.  This process minimizes manual intervention and reduces complexity for both students and administrators.
