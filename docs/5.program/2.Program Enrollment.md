# Program and Cohort Enrollment

This document outlines the process for users to discover, apply for, and enroll in programs and their associated cohorts within the online university system.

## I. Program Discovery and Selection

1.  **Program Listing Page:**
    *   Users browse available programs on a dedicated listing page.
    *   Programs are categorized for easy navigation (e.g., by subject, level, or other criteria).
    *   **Program Cards** display concise information:
        *   Title
        *   Short Description
        *   Category
        *   Thumbnail Image
        *   Enrollment Status (Open/Closed)
        *   "Learn More" button

2.  **Program Details Page:**
    *   Clicking "Learn More" on a Program Card directs users to a comprehensive Program Details Page.
    *   This page provides in-depth information through tabs:
        *   Overview
        *   Curriculum
        *   Career Paths
        *   Faculty
        *   Admissions
        *   Fees & Funding
    *   Available cohorts (with start/end dates) are clearly displayed.

3.  **Restricted Programs:**
    *   Programs with prerequisites (e.g., prior courses, degrees) are visually indicated (e.g., lock icon, disabled "Apply Now" button).
    *   Tooltips or messages explain the specific requirements.
    *   Users lacking prerequisites are guided on how to fulfill them.

## II. Cohort Selection and Enrollment Process

1.  **Initiating Enrollment:**
    *   A prominent "Apply Now" or "Enroll" button on the Program Details Page initiates the enrollment process.
    *   The system's behavior depends on the program/cohort configuration:
        *   **Open Enrollment:**  Leads to a simplified enrollment form (Scenario A).
        *   **Application Required:**  Leads to a detailed application form (Scenario B).
        *   **Closed Enrollment:**  Displays a message indicating closure, potentially with options for a waiting list or notification upon reopening.
        *   **Invite Only:** cohort can be only accessed via invite links.

2.  **Prerequisite Check:**
    *   The system automatically verifies if the user meets any prerequisites for the selected program or cohort.
    *   If prerequisites are not met, a clear message informs the user and provides guidance.

3.  **No Duplicate Enrollments:**
    *   The system prevents users from enrolling in multiple cohorts of the same program simultaneously.

## III. Enrollment Scenarios

**Scenario A: Open Enrollment (Simplified)**

1.  **Enrollment Form:**  A concise form collects essential information:
    *   Preferred name for certificate
    *   Contact information
    *   Cohort selection (explicitly chosen by the user)

2.  **Immediate Confirmation:**  Upon submission, the user receives:
    *   Confirmation of enrollment.
    *   Immediate access to program and cohort resources.

**Scenario B: Application Process (With Approval)**

1.  **Application Form:** A comprehensive form gathers:
    *   **Personal Information:** Name, contact details, educational background.
    *   **Program-Specific Questions (Optional):**  To assess suitability.
    *   **Statement of Purpose (Optional):**  User's motivations for joining.
    *   **Supporting Documents (Optional):** Transcripts, resumes, etc.
    *   **Entrance Quiz/Exam (Optional):**  An assessment; scores are linked to the application.

2.  **Application Submission and Review:**
    *   User receives confirmation of submission.
    *   The application undergoes review:
        *   **Auto-Approval:**  Possible for some programs based on predefined criteria.
        *   **Admin Review:**  Manual review by university administrators, considering application details and exam scores (if applicable).
        *   Users are informed about the estimated review timeframe.

3.  **Application Status Updates:**
    *   Users receive updates (via email and/or platform notifications) on their application status:
        *   Pending Review
        *   Accepted
        *   Rejected

4.  **Acceptance and Enrollment:**
    *   Accepted applicants receive instructions to complete enrollment:
        *   Confirm preferred name.
        *   Finalize payment (if applicable).
        *   Select a cohort (if multiple options are available based on acceptance date or other settings).

5.  **Rejection:**
    *   Rejected applicants may receive feedback or reasons for the decision.
    *   Retake options for entrance exams (if applicable) may be provided.
6. **Invite Links:**
    * For special cases like scholarships, users might get links for direct access to a cohort.

## IV. Enrollment and Program Statuses

1.  **Program Status:**
    *   **Open:**  Accepting enrollments for current or future cohorts.
    *   **Closed:**  Not accepting new enrollments. Past or future cohort dates may be displayed.

2.  **Enrollment Status:**
    *   **Not Applied:**  User has not initiated the enrollment process.
    *   **Pending Approval:**  Application submitted, awaiting review.
    *   **Approved (Enrolled):**  Granted admission to a cohort; access to program content is unlocked.
    *   **Rejected:**  Application not accepted; reasons and potential retake options are communicated.
    *   **Withdrawn:**  User voluntarily canceled enrollment; refund/credit transfer policies apply.
    *   **Completed:**  User successfully finished all cohort requirements.
    *   **Transferred:**  Student moved to a subsequent cohort due to failure to meet progression requirements; records reflect completed and pending coursework.

## V. Post-Enrollment Experience

1.  **Cohort Confirmation:**  Users are officially enrolled in their chosen cohort and cannot switch to another live cohort within the same program.

2.  **Program Access:**  Enrolled students gain access to:
    *   **Dashboard (Student Hub):**  Overview of cohort progress, deadlines, announcements, recent activity, and access to materials.
    *   **Content Page:**  Curriculum displayed according to the cohort's branch (semesters, courses, lectures, resources).
    *   **Grades Page:**  Progress and grades specific to the enrolled cohort.
    *   **Certification Page:**  Management of certificates for completed academic years or programs within the cohort.
    *   **Community Forum:** (and other features according to course and program rules.)

3.  **Onboarding and Orientation (Optional):**  New students may be guided through an onboarding process or provided with program-specific orientation materials.

## VI. Technical Considerations

1.  **Backend Logic:**  Robust backend systems are required to manage:
    *   Program applications
    *   Enrollment processes
    *   Cohort assignments
    *   User accounts

2.  **Database Design:**  The database schema must effectively track:
    *   Student enrollments
    *   Cohort assignments
    *   Program statuses
    *   Application details

3.  **User Interface:**  Intuitive user interfaces are crucial for:
    *   Program browsing
    *   Cohort selection
    *   Application/enrollment process
    *   Accommodating various user scenarios and access levels

4.  **Communication System:**  A system for automated communication is essential for:
    *   Application status updates
    *   Acceptance/rejection notifications
    *   Other important messages
