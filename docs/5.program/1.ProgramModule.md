## Program Enrollment and Signup Options

**1. Program Discovery and Selection:**

* Users browse the **Program Listing Page** to explore available programs, categorized for easy navigation.
* **Program Cards** provide essential details: title, short description, category, thumbnail, signup status (open/closed), and a "Learn More" button.
* Restricted programs (with prerequisites) display a visual indicator (e.g., lock icon, disabled button) and tooltip explaining requirements.
* Clicking "Learn More" takes users to a dedicated **Program Page** with detailed information (tabs for Overview, Curriculum, Career Paths, Faculty, Admissions, Fees & Funding).

**2. Cohort Selection and Enrollment:**

* If a program is open for enrollment, the Program Page displays available cohorts (typically yearly).  Each cohort will likely have its start/end dates clearly displayed.
* A prominent "Apply Now" button initiates the enrollment process for the selected cohort.
* **No duplicate enrollments:** The system validates that the user isn't already enrolled in another cohort of the same program.
* **Prerequisites check:** If the program or chosen cohort has prerequisites (other courses or programs), the system checks if the user meets them. If not, a clear message directs them to fulfill the requirements before applying.

**3. Signup Options and Enrollment Methods:**

* **Direct Enrollment (Self-Applying):** For some programs, users might be able to enroll and automatically join a cohort.
* **Application with Approval:** Other programs may require an application process.  This could include:
    * **Application Form:** Gathering additional information from the user.
    * **Document Uploads:** Submitting transcripts, resumes, or other documents.
    * **Entrance Quiz/Exam:** Some programs might have entry requirements in the form of an assessment. Scores would be recorded and linked to the application.
    * **Admin Approval:** University administrators review applications, considering exam scores and other criteria, before granting admission to a cohort.
* **Invite Links:** For specific scenarios (scholarships, partnerships), users might receive unique invite links that grant direct access to a cohort.

**4. Enrollment Status and Program Status:**

* **Program Status:**
    * **Open:** Accepting enrollments for existing or upcoming cohorts.
    * **Closed:** Not accepting new enrollments.  Start/end dates of past or future cohorts may be displayed.
* **Enrollment Status:**
    * **Not Applied:** User has not started the enrollment process.
    * **Pending Approval:** Application submitted, awaiting administrative review.
    * **Approved (Enrolled):** Granted admission to a cohort. The user can now access program content and features. This would likely change the user's view of the Course Page, unlocking relevant content, lectures, etc.
    * **Rejected:**  Application not accepted. Reason for rejection and possibly retake options (for exams) would be communicated.
    * **Withdrawn:**  User actively cancels their enrollment in a cohort.  Conditions for refunds or credit transfers would be handled here.
    * **Completed:** User successfully finishes all requirements for the cohort.
    * **Transferred:** Student moved to the next cohort due to failing to meet progression requirements.  Their records would reflect completed coursework in the original cohort and pending coursework in the new one.


**5.  Post-Enrollment Experience:**

* Upon successful enrollment, users have context-specific access to the platform:
    * **Dashboard (Student Hub):** Provides an overview of the enrolled cohort's progress, upcoming deadlines, announcements, recent activity, and access to course materials.
    * **Content Page:** Displays the curriculum according to the cohort's branch, showing the correct semesters, courses, lectures, and resources.
    * **Grades Page:** Dedicated to showing progress and grades within the context of the enrolled cohort.
    * **Certification Page:** Manages certificates issued for completed academic years or programs within the cohort.
