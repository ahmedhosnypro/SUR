# Online University Management System (OUMS) - Product Requirements Document


## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Overview

The Online University Management System (OUMS) is a comprehensive, web-based platform designed to manage all aspects of a fully online university.  It provides enhanced functionality beyond a traditional Learning Management System (LMS), supporting cohort-based learning, dynamic course creation, streamlined administrative operations, and comprehensive program management.

### 1.2 Purpose

The purpose of OUMS is to:

*   Provide a comprehensive platform for online university management.
*   Deliver a seamless and engaging learning experience for students.
*   Streamline administrative tasks for staff and faculty.
*   Support flexible, cohort-based learning.
*   Enable program and course visualizations for easy navigation and tracking.

### 1.3 Target Audience

The target audience for OUMS includes:

*   **Students:** Individuals seeking online education.
*   **Instructors:** Faculty members responsible for delivering content and assessing student learning.
*   **Administrators:** Staff responsible for managing system operations and user accounts.

### 1.4 Key Features
* **Cohort-Based System:** Students enroll in specific cohorts per program.
* **Dynamic Course Creation:** New courses can be added and managed at any time.
* **Automatic Cohort Generation:** Cohorts are created on a predefined schedule (e.g., annually).
* **Grade and Certificate Persistence:** Grades and certificates carry over to subsequent cohorts if a student needs to repeat a year.
* **Abstract Courses:** Stand-alone courses are available to all users, regardless of program enrollment.
* **Curriculum Branching:**  Each program has a "Main Branch" (template) and "Cohort Branches" for each cohort, allowing for versioning and cohort-specific modifications.

## 2. System Architecture

### 2.1 Core Modules

The system is composed of the following interconnected modules:

1.  **User Management Module:** Handles user registration, authentication, role-based access control, profile management, and identity verification.
2.  **Program Management Module:** Manages the creation, organization, and maintenance of academic programs, including curriculum structure (Main Branches) and program-specific settings.
3.  **Cohort Management Module:** Creates, schedules, and manages student cohorts, including enrollment, progression, and cohort-specific curriculum branches.
4.  **Course Management Module:**  Allows instructors and administrators to create, edit, and manage courses, including content management, prerequisite management, and access control.
5.  **Learning Management System (LMS) Module:**  Provides lecture delivery, quiz administration, progress tracking, and basic communication tools. (Note: This module may be closely integrated with the Course Management Module.)
6.  **Grading and Certification Module:**  Calculates grades, manages gradebooks, generates certificates, and handles certificate management.
7.  **Communication Module:**  Provides announcements, discussion forums, live session integration, and messaging capabilities.
8.  **Library Management Module:**  Manages library resources (books, articles, documents, lecture notes), including categorization, search, and access control.
9.  **Live Session Management Module:**  Schedules live sessions, integrates with a third-party video conferencing platform, and manages session recordings.
10. **Reporting and Analytics Module:**  Tracks student progress, grade analytics, system usage, and provides data export capabilities.
11. **Administrative Module:**  Provides system configuration, user management, reporting, and data export functionalities.

### 2.2 Content Organization Logic

The system follows a hierarchical content organization structure:

**Faculties (Programs) > Main Branch > Cohort Branches > Academic Years > Semesters > Courses > Lectures/Quizzes/Assignments**

*   **Faculties:** Represent different departments or subject areas.
*   **Main Branch:** The primary curriculum structure template for a program.
*   **Cohort Branches:** Individual, cohort-specific branches derived from the Main Branch.  Changes to the Main Branch can be propagated to Cohort Branches.
*   **Abstract Courses:** Stand-alone courses that exist outside of the program structure and are accessible to all users.

### 2.3 Database Structure (Simplified)

The database includes entities and relationships to support the content organization and cohort-based structure. Key entities include:

*   Program
*   Main Branch
*   Cohort Branch
*   Academic Year
*   Semester
*   Course
*   Lecture
*   Quiz
*   Assignment
*   Student
*   Enrollment
*   Grade
*   Certificate
* User

Relationships:
* Program → Multiple Main Branches
* Main Branch → Multiple Academic Years
* Academic Year → Multiple Semesters
* Semester → Multiple Courses
* Course → Multiple Lectures/Quizzes
* Student → Multiple Enrollments

## 3. System Logic and Flow

### 3.1 User Authentication and Authorization

*   **Public Users:** Can access limited website content (homepage, about us, program listings, open courses, global library section).
*   **Enrolled Students:** Have access to program-specific content, courses, their dashboard, grades, and other restricted resources.
*   **User Roles:** Different user roles (student, instructor, administrator, program controller) have varying levels of access and permissions within the system.

### 3.2 Program and Cohort Management

*   **Program Controllers:** Create and manage programs, define curriculum structures in the Main Branch, set enrollment periods, and manage program-specific settings.
*   **Cohort Generation:** The system automatically generates cohorts based on a predefined schedule or manually by administrators.
*   **Cohort Branching:** Each cohort inherits the curriculum structure from the Main Branch, creating a new Cohort Branch.  Changes to the Main Branch can be propagated to Cohort Branches.
*   **Student Enrollment:** Students can enroll in an open cohort of a program. A student can be enrolled in only one cohort at a time per program.

### 3.3 Course and Content Delivery

*   **Instructors:** Create and manage courses within their assigned programs. New courses are automatically added to relevant cohorts.
*   **Content Organization:** Content (lectures, quizzes, assignments) is organized within courses.
*   **Access Control:** Restricts content visibility based on student enrollment, course progress, and prerequisites.
*   **Progress Tracking:** The system tracks student progress and marks lectures, quizzes, and assignments as complete.

### 3.4 Grading and Certification

*   **Grade Calculation:** Grades are recorded for quizzes, assignments, and other assessments. The system calculates course grades, semester grades, and overall program grades.
*   **Certificate Generation:** Certificates are generated and issued automatically upon successful completion of courses, academic years or programs.
*   **Grade and Certificate Persistence:** Certificates and grades persist if students move to the next cohort (e.g., if they fail to progress).

### 3.5 Live Sessions and Community

*   **Live Sessions:** Live sessions are scheduled and managed within courses or programs. Session recordings are made available.
*   **Community Integration:** Integration with Telegram provides program-specific communication channels for students and instructors.
